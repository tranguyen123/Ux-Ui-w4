    <li>The designer of this website used contrast in color (black-white, blue-red) to creact an outstanding impression to the user</li>
    <li>All the container and information were put on a white background to keep the clean, clear and nit visualization for the web. As the same time, the white background will help bring out all the colors in his photo better. </li>
    <li>I think he made a very good choice to wear a blue shirt in a black background for his portrail. And then he applied this concept on a dark red setting landscape background with the white front. This choice put the user attetion to his main menu which contains his contact information and help the users navigating his page easily.</li>

    <li>White, yellow, black and teal colors were spreaded equally through out the page, and creacted a symmetrical harmony.</li>
